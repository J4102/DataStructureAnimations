# DataStructureAnimations

To visit our website please go to www.cjs-datastructures.com

This is a website that was created by Crystal Ho and Johnny Yang to teach CS students the concepts of datastructures in a visual informative way. We include information, animations, and also interview questions to help hone the power of datastructures. 

The datastructures featured are linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and hashtables. Each page features a different datastructure with its corresponding information. There also contains animations demonstrating how the datastructures change with different functions (insertions, deletions, etc).
